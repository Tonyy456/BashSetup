# BashSetup
Sets up a bash environment to Anthony D'Alesandro's Liking.

# Idea
Have a interface for changes made to system
- has a build()
- has a breakdown()
in build, it adds folders or whatever and breakdown undoes that change.

Allows the system to quickly be torn down for testing...

# Folders
- programs
    - unity
    - subfolder for language? probably not
    - subfolder for categories? game, web, mobile app
- libs
    - contains downloads of software that you can reference
    - custom command to get path of libs
- commands
    - custom commands added to the $PATH variable
- trash
    - items I intend to delete later
- resources
    - things I might want to reference. Tutorials, etc.
- snippets
    - small snippets that might be useful
- tools
    - small projects that are tools
- scripts
    - small scripts that dont need to be commands but are nonethless sometimes useful
- assets
- backups
- repositories
